# Overview

The software I have developed works hand in hand with the cloud service Google Firebase. The purpose of the software is to be able to read, write, modify, and delete data from a database structure table stored in the firebase cloud.

# Cloud Database

I am using Google's Firebase cloud storage in order to a store a table of data that can be interacted with through the python program.

The structure of the database table currently is *users -> attributes.*

# Development Environment

## Tools & Languages
* Google Firebase
* VS Code
* Github
* Python 3.11

# Future Work

- Ability to modify data from the interface
- The ability to edit more than just users from the interface.
- A better interface for the user to more easily interact with the data.
- Variables are messy because I coded as I learned.
